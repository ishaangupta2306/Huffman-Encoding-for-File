# Huffman-Encoding-for-File
This project focuses on the huffman encoding. Basically, the huffmanCompressor method takes the names of input and output text files. It reads the content of the input files, develops huffman codes for each character (including special characters like '\n') and puts that information into a hashTable. Finally, it again reads the input file and puts the huffman codes for each character into the output file. During this process, two more text files are also generated. One text file named: huffmanCode.txt contains a table having the information of each character, its frequency in the input file and its huffman code. The second text file named: spaceSaving.txt is where the amount of memory saved is put when instead of 8 bit characters, their huffmanCodes are used. All these processes are breaken down into smaller helper methods which are individually tested for appropriate possible scenarios and finally integrated together to achieve the goal of the project.
