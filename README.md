# Huffman-Encoding-for-File
This project focuses on the huffman encoding. Basically, the HuffmanCompressor method takes the names of input and output files. It reads the content of the input files, develops huffman codes for each character (including special characters like '\n') and puts that information into a hashTable. Finally, while reading the input file it puts the huffman codes for each character into the output file (input by the user). During this process, it also generates a text file which contains a table having the information of each character. its frequency in the input file and its huffman code. The method also generates another text file named: spaceSaving.txt where it puts the amount of memory saved when huffman codes where used instead of 8 bit characters. All these processes are breaken down into helper methods which are individually tested for appropriate possible scenarios and finally integrated together to achieve the goal of the project.
